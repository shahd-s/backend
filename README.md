The back-end portion to a small-ecommerce log in/sign up system; front-end can be found [here](https://github.com/shahd-s/small-ecom). 

## Project Description

This project uses EF/fluent-API to create the DB in code. There is one [main controller](https://github.com/shahd-s/backend/blob/master/backend/Controllers/TestController.cs) that communicates with the front-end. More info can be found at the front-end repo.
